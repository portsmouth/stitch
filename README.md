# stitch

Stitch is a Python script to assemble large Google maps. A rectangle of latitude and longitude is specified (or generated via the 
coordinates tool below), as well as the desired map dimensions.
The appropriate tiles are then automatically downloaded and stitched together into a single map (which is cropped
to precisely match the specified rectangle).  An examples of the large maps you can make is shown below.

A Google maps app for selecting the map location is provided here: https://rawgit.com/portsmouth/stitch/master/stitch.html
