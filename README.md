# stitch

Stitch is a Python script to assemble extremely detailed satellite and terrain maps via stitching of content obtained via the Google maps API. A rectangle of latitude and longitude is specified (or generated via the coordinates tool available [**here**](http://rawgit.com/portsmouth/stitch/master/stitch.html)), as well as the desired map dimensions. The appropriate tiles are then automatically downloaded and stitched together into a single map (which is cropped
to precisely match the specified rectangle).  An examples of the large maps you can make is shown below.

A Google maps app for selecting the map location is provided [**here**](http://rawgit.com/portsmouth/stitch/master/stitch.html).
